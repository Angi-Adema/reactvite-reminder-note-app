## Future Development

- Build a profile page so the user can login, update their password and/or email as well as the ability to delete the user account. Includes confirmation on the navbar of current user logged in.
- During user sign up, add a password confirmation field to be sure the passwords are identical. Also, link Google so the user can opt to using their Google login to create an account.
- Would like to make it so that different color sticky notes can be used to color code different tasks or reminders.
- Possibly add a calendar to the functionality to manage deadlines for some of the reminder notes.
